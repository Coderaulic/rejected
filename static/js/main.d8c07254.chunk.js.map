So why interview without adequitely preparing? Practice coding on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I strongly recommend that you pick a language with OOP such as C++, C#, Java. Every language has its strengths and weaknesses but the ones listed are common enough that most interviewers would already know them as well.

I found I learn so much more when creating a project. For example, this very app has improved my web development skills. There are also many project ideas out there. Udemy has many interesting courses to learn and has also helped me ace interviews. Sometimes, having a project portfolio can be the difference between getting an interview or not.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Starting one is easy, but make sure to finish and complete them. Don't just have a collection of 'Hello World' apps. The best ones to show are projects that are involved, with more complexity and challenges that showcase  a variety of skills.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className='tips'>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div className='about'>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className='container'>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<PanelGroup\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccordion\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tid=\"tips-accordion\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonSelect={ this.handleSelect }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactiveKey={ this.state.activeKey }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel eventKey={ 1 }>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Title toggle>{ <h3>Applicants vs Candidates</h3> }</Panel.Title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Body collapsible>{ this.applicantsVsCandidates() }</Panel.Body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel eventKey={ 2 }>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Title toggle>{ <h3>Coding For Interviews</h3> }</Panel.Title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Body collapsible>{ this.codingForInterviews() }</Panel.Body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel eventKey={ 3 }>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Title toggle>{ <h3>Programming Practice</h3> }</Panel.Title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Body collapsible>{ this.practice() }</Panel.Body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel eventKey={ 4 }>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Title toggle>{ <h3>Resource Links</h3> }</Panel.Title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Body collapsible>{ this.resourceLinks() }</Panel.Body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel eventKey={ 5 }>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Title toggle>{ <h3>Projects</h3> }</Panel.Title>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel.Heading>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Panel.Body collapsible>{ this.projects() }</Panel.Body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Panel>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</PanelGroup>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Tips;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\n// Simple component to allow props.children to be scrollable\r\nconst Scroll = (props) => {\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<div className='scroll'>\r\n\t\t\t{ props.children }\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Scroll;\r\n","import $ from 'jquery';\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport imgStamp from '../img/stamp.png';\r\nimport imgRejected from '../img/rejected.png';\r\nimport imgGhosted from '../img/ghosted.jpg'\r\nimport imgNoMessages from '../img/noMessages.jpg';\r\nimport imgNoResponse from '../img/noResponse.png';\r\nimport imgBeingGhosted from '../img/being-ghosted.jpg';\r\nimport { Modal, Button, Glyphicon } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\nimport jab from '../sfx/jab.mp3';\r\nimport thump from '../sfx/thump.mp3';\r\nimport splat from '../sfx/splat.mp3';\r\nimport whack from '../sfx/whack.mp3';\r\nimport poStamp from '../sfx/post-office-stamp.mp3';\r\nimport rubberStamp from '../sfx/rubber-stamp.mp3';\r\n\r\n\r\n// Class to represent the application details in a modal.\r\n// Added A/D and LeftArrow/RightArrow keys to navigate prev/next easier, W/UpArrow for close modal.\r\n// Opening/Closing of modal handled by Redux: 'onUpdateActiveCardID', sets the activeCardID back to -1 on close.\r\n// From Card click, it sets the id to that card.
